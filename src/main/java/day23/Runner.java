    1)Super() is used to call constructors from parent class.
    ~ if the parent class has multiple constructors by the help of the parameters you can select any constructor.
    ~ typing super() is optional but if you use super() with parameters you have to type it.
    ~ super() must be in the first line in constructor body.
    ~ super() can be used just once in a constructor body

    2) this() is used to call constructors from the class itself.
    ~ if the parent class has multiple constructors by the help of the parameters you can select any constructor.
    ~ typing this() is not optional you have to type it.
    ~ this() must be in the first line in constructor body.
    ~ this() can be used just once in a constructor body

    this() and super() cannot be used together in the same constructor body
