    1) final methods: body cannot be updated cannot be overridden.
    2) if a variable is final variable: you have to initialize it. Example: final int x =0;
    3) after initializing, the value of the final variable cannot be updated.
    4) If a class is final class, cannot have child classes but final class can be a child class.
    5) All wrapper classes are final classes
    6)All immutable classes are final classes so String is a final class
